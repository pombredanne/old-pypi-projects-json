        "description": "bitcoinkey: A Swiss bank on your $5 USB stick \n==============================================\n\n**bitcoinkey** is a tool that helps you create a secure Bitcoin wallet on any USB flash drive and perform transactions using your command line.\n\nIt creates an encrypted file (`key.enc`) on your USB flash drive containing your Bitcoin private key. To perform any operation, you'll have to enter your previously registred password. Otherwise, any operation is impossible.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nIt's as simple as:\n```bash\n$ pip install bitcoinkey\n```\n\nUsage\n------------\n\n**Important:** **bitcoinkey** isn't as secured as a REAL hardware wallet, so don't use it as your main way to store your Bitcoins!\n\nBefore you start using **bitcoinkey**, you have to format a USB flash drive to any format you want (preferably FAT32 for portability) and rename the key to `BTC` on formating.\n\nOnce done, go to your command line and run:\n```bash\n$ bitcoinkey\n```\nYou will then be invited to create a new password for your wallet. Choose a strong password and remember everyone with access to your USB wallet, your password and **bitcoinkey** has access to your Bitcoins.\n\nAfter creating a password, you'll be asked to re-run the program. Then to enter your password again. When done, you will have access to a prompt with the following options:\n\n```\n1 \u2013 Print your Bitcoin address\n2 \u2013 Get your wallet balance in a given currency\n3 \u2013 Get your transaction history\n4 \u2013 Make a transaction\n5 \u2013 Get transaction fees in satoshis per byte\n6 \u2013 Create a new wallet\n7 \u2013 Print your Bitcoin Segwit address\n0 \u2013 Exit\n```\nYou can then select an options by entering the **corresponding number** followed by **return**.\n\nAbout\n------------\nMy vision is to create a simple way for people who cannot afford a hardware wallet such as the [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) or the [Trezor](https://trezor.io/) to carry their cryptocurrencies in a secure way.\nThe long-term goal is to establish a universal protocol or convention to create a hardware wallet and access it with any software. Monopoly isn't something we should support in the crypto space, instead we should focus on making things simpler and open for everyone.\n\nBased on community needs and demands, I will add support for more cryptocurrencies on **bitcoinkey**, including but not limited to: Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and Litecoin. You can help me do that by **contributing** to the project or by **donating** a little something to encourage me.\n\n**Donate BTC:** 1D17aB3neeeWqKzb3gdGEbk8SC12SNeqAC\n\n**Donate BCH:** qz5mle4x2vjelax2c0wxhuprq5ha63w4xsj0r38g8s\n\n**Donate ETH:** 0x56D6C69EC22Ee78A0454A165738A20a2e961385d\n\n**Donate Love:** Just [tweet](https://twitter.com/merwanedr) me something cool :)\n\nContributing\n------------\nIf you like **bitcoinkey** so much that you want to contribute to it, you can make a pull request on a new branch wether it is for a bugfix or for a new feature. \n\nYou can also request a feature or report a bug by using Github issues, or by dropping me an [email](mailto:merwanedr@gmail.com) if you're not technical.\n\nPromoting the project is also considered a huge contribution! Any action is welcome as long as it helps **bitcoinkey** grow! \n\nNotes and credits\n------------\n* I really wanted to thank [Ofek Lev](https://github.com/ofek) for his library [bit](https://github.com/ofek/bit) which made **bitcoinkey** possible without me having a headache, your library rocks!\n\n* I tested **bitcoinkey** on MacOS and Linux but I don't know if it works well on Windows. It would be cool if one of you contributors can test it and create an issue if it doesn't work properly.\n\n\n",
