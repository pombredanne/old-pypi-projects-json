Are you tired of implementing your techniques? If yes, Recogners is the real deal! This package provides an easy-to-go implementation of machine learning algorithms. From datasets to fully-customizable models, from internal functions to external communication, we will foster all research related to machine learning.\n\nUse Recogners if you need a library or wish to:\n* Create your machine learning algorithm.\n* Design or use pre-loaded learners.\n* Mix-and-match different strategies to solve your problem.\n* Because it is incredible to learn things.\n\nRead the docs at [recogners.readthedocs.io](https://recogners.readthedocs.io).\n\nRecogners is compatible with: **Python 3.6 and 3.7**.\n\n---\n\n## Package guidelines\n\n1. The very first information you need is in the very **next** section.\n2. **Installing** is also easy if you wish to read the code and bump yourself into, follow along.\n3. Note that there might be some **additional** steps in order to use our solutions.\n4. If there is a problem, please do not **hesitate**, call us.\n\n---\n\n## Getting started: 60 seconds with recogners\n\nFirst of all. We have examples. Yes, they are commented. Just browse to `examples/`, chose your subpackage, and follow the example. We have high-level examples for most tasks we could think of.\n\nAlternatively, if you wish to learn even more, please take a minute:\n\nRecogners is based on the following structure, and you should pay attention to its tree:\n\n```\n- recogners\n    - core\n        - dataset\n        - model\n    - datasets\n        - opf\n    - math\n        - scale\n    - models\n        - dropout_rbm\n        - rbm\n    - utils\n        - loader\n        - logging\n    - visual\n        - image\n        - plot\n```\n\n### Core\n\nCore is the core. Essentially, it is the parent of everything. You should find parent classes defining the basis of our structure. They should provide variables and methods that will help to construct other modules.\n\n### Datasets\n\nAs we are building over PyTorch, we will also provide some integrations with other techniques used by our laboratory. Initially, you can load all OPF text files into this library.\n\n### Math\n\nJust because we are computing stuff, it does not means that we do not need math. Math is the mathematical package, containing low-level math implementations. From random numbers to distributions generation, you can find your needs on this module.\n\n### Models\n\nThis is the heart. All models are declared and implemented here. We will offer you the most fantastic implementation of everything we are working with. Please take a closer look into this package.\n\n### Utils\n\nThis is a utility package. Common things shared across the application should be implemented here. It is better to implement once and use as you wish than re-implementing the same thing over and over again.\n\n### Visual\n\nEveryone needs images and plots to help visualize what is happening, correct? This package will provide every visual-related method for you. Check a specific image, your fitness function convergence, plot reconstructions, weights, and much more!\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\nWe believe that everything has to be easy. Not tricky or daunting, Recogners will be the one-to-go package that you will need, from the very first installation to the daily-tasks implementing needs. If you may just run the following under your most preferred Python environment (raw, conda, virtualenv, whatever):\n\n```Python\npip install recogners\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer to install the bleeding-edge version, please clone this repository and use:\n\n```Python\npip install .\n```\n\n---\n\n## Environment configuration\n\nNote that sometimes, there is a need for additional implementation. If needed, from here you will be the one to know all of its details.\n\n### Ubuntu\n\nNo specific additional commands needed.\n\n### Windows\n\nNo specific additional commands needed.\n\n### MacOS\n\nNo specific additional commands needed.\n\n---\n\n## Support\n\nWe know that we do our best, but it is inevitable to acknowledge that we make mistakes. If you ever need to report a bug, report a problem, talk to us, please do so! We will be available at our bests at this repository or recogna@fc.unesp.br.\n\n---\n\n\n",
