        "description": "SQL Bootstrap\n=============\n\nAn opinionated lightweight wrapper around various SQL backend drivers.\n\nSupport right now is available for the following:\n\n- MySQL / MariaDB via ``mysqlclient``\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Opens and closes a connection for every query. I realize this is not what everyone needs. But I use this workflow in a lot of my projects, hence, opinionated.\n- Uses ``yield`` to return a generator to fetch large amount of data from a DB without loading everything into the memory.\n- Logs last executed query and time for query execution with a unique ID so queries can be traced in log messages.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n.. code-block::\n\n    pip install sql_bootstrap\n\nMake sure you are also installing the appropriate drivers for your respective backend as mentioned above.\n\nOr you can install with driver like this:\n\n.. code-block::\n\n    pip install sql_bootstrap[mysql]\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n.. code-block::\n\n    # import this\n    from sql_bootstrap.backends.mysql import MySQL\n\n    # create the DB object; no connection is done at this point\n    # any argument accepted by the underlying DB driver can be passed\n    db = MySQL(host='', user='', passwd='', db='')\n\n    # run queries like so\n\n    # select large data\n    rows = db.execute(\"SELECT * FROM blah\")\n    for row in rows:\n        print(row)\n\n    # insert data\n    db.execute(\n        'INSERT INTO blah(key) VALUE (%s)',\n        ('value1', )\n    )\n\n\nThis is an excerpt of the log messages using ``basicConfig``. This will change depending on your logging configuration::\n\n    INFO:sql_bootstrap.backends:f2e47d87874d4055beba66b6c8221aff - Connecting to DB\n    INFO:sql_bootstrap.backends.mysql:f2e47d87874d4055beba66b6c8221aff - Starting executing query at 2019-10-28 15:47:31.182261\n    INFO:sql_bootstrap.backends.mysql:f2e47d87874d4055beba66b6c8221aff - SELECT * FROM blah\n    INFO:sql_bootstrap.backends.mysql:f2e47d87874d4055beba66b6c8221aff - 2844047 row(s) affected in 10 second(s)\n    INFO:sql_bootstrap.backends.mysql:f2e47d87874d4055beba66b6c8221aff - Ended query execution at 2019-10-28 15:47:41.747841\n    INFO:sql_bootstrap.backends:f2e47d87874d4055beba66b6c8221aff - Closed connection to DB\n\nTODO\n----\n\n- Add support for other DB backends.\n- Add tests.\n",
