        "description": "The WordUtils package provides objects related to word searching and matching.\nThe eventual goal is to develop a suite of objects that are suitable for\nbuilding word games in the tradition of Scrabble (tm).\n\nAll of the objects provide similar functionality with a similar interface, but\nare implemented in terms of different underlying data structures.  Currently,\nobjects implementing two different data structures are complete: the Dawg\nobject, which implements a directed acyclic word graph, and the\nTernarySearchTree object, which implements a ternary search tree.",
