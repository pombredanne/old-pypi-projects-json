        "description": "shapeup\n=======\n\n`Shapely <https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html>`__ is\ngreat for working with geometries, but if you're dealing with Geographic\nInformation Systems\n(`GIS <https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/geographic-information-system-gis/>`__)\nthere are times when you really need your geometries to have some\nawareness of `spatial\nreference <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system>`__.\nThis project seeks to combine ``Shapely`` with\n`pyproj <https://pypi.org/project/pyproj/>`__ and some other\nconveniences to make working with geometries across spatial references\neasy and fun!\n\nProject Features\n----------------\n\n-  `shapeup <https://readthedocs.org/projects/shapeup/>`__\n-  automated unit tests you can run with\n   `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`__\n-  a `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`__ documentation\n   project\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\nThe project's documentation contains a section to help you `get\nstarted <https://shapeup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html>`__\nas a developer or user of the library.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nWGS84 to UTM\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn this example we'll start with a latitude and a longitude and create a\npoint that happens to be in `UTM zone\n15N <https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/32615/>`__ (32615). We'll\nthen use the ``as_utm`` method to create the equivalent point in the UTM\ncoordinate system.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from shapeup import SrPoint\n\n    # Create a point from a latitude, longitude.\n    wgs84 = SrPoint.from_lat_lon(lat=45.553670, lon=-94.142430)\n\n    # Convert it to UTM.\n    utm = wgs84.as_utm()\n\n    # What are the coordinates of the UTM point?\n    print(f'x={utm.x}, y={utm.y}')\n\n    # What's the SRID of the UTM point's coordinate system.\n    print(f\"The UTM SRID is: {utm.srid}\")\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    x=410830.5412685075, y=5045093.805781859\n    The UTM SRID is: 32615\n\nFor more examples and other information, visit the [documentation\npage]((https://readthedocs.org/projects/shapeup/).\n\nDevelopment Prerequisites\n-------------------------\n\nIf you're going to be working in the code (rather than just using the\nlibrary), you'll want a few utilities.\n\n-  `GNU Make <https://www.gnu.org/software/make/>`__\n-  `Pandoc <https://pandoc.org/>`__\n\nResources\n---------\n\nBelow are some handy resource links.\n\n-  `Project Documentation <http://shapeup.readthedocs.io/>`__\n-  `Click <http://click.pocoo.org/5/>`__ is a Python package for\n   creating beautiful command line interfaces in a composable way with\n   as little code as necessary.\n-  `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`__ is a tool that\n   makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation,\n   written by Geog Brandl and licnsed under the BSD license.\n-  `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`__ helps you write\n   better programs.\n-  [GNU Make] is a tool which controls the generation of executables and\n   other non-source files of a program from the program's source files.\n\nAuthors\n-------\n\n-  **Pat Daburu** - *Initial work* -\n   `github <https://github.com/patdaburu>`__\n\nSee also the list of\n`contributors <https://github.com/patdaburu/shapeup/contributors>`__ who\nparticipated in this project.\n\nLicenseMIT License\n------------------\n\nCopyright (c) patdaburu\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.",
