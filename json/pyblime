Yeah, that's also possible\n  to do with python :D\n\nOr maybe you just don't care about the widgets provided by pyblime but you're\ninterested to use the awesome [syntect](https://github.com/brupelo/pysyntect)\nlibrary in python, that's also possible as pyblime gives you [pysyntect](https://github.com/brupelo/pysyntect)!!!\n\n...\n\nThere are many other reasons you should give it a shot to pyblime though ;)\n\n# How to get started?\n\nFirst you should read the available [docs](./docs), specially the one that explains how to\n[build](./docs/build.md) pyblime, going through those docs shouldn't take more than\n5 minutes. Once you've installed pyblime you should check the tutorials:\n\n- `python examples/tutorials.py`\n\nAt this point, you should have a nice overall view of the project, I suggest you\nfocus on [tutorial_04.py](./examples/tutorial_04.py), that tutorial will explain\nyou how to use SublimeText code in pyblime.\n\n# References/Credits\n\nThe following projects were used:\n\n- [sublimetext](https://www.sublimetext.com) Target to emulate :)\n- [syntect](https://github.com/trishume/syntect) Rust library for syntax highlighting using Sublime Text syntax definitions\n- [pysyntect](https://github.com/brupelo/pysyntect) Python bindings for syntect\n- [pyo3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3) Rust bindings for Python. Used to create the syntect python bindings\n- [qscintilla](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/qscintilla/intro) QScintilla is a port to Qt of Neil Hodgson's Scintilla C++ editor control\n- [scintilla](https://www.scintilla.org/) Used by QScintilla\n- [pyqt](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) PyQt brings together the Qt C++ cross-platform application framework and the cross-platform interpreted language Python\n- [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3809375/bpl) You'll see how many of my questions are related to the goal of creating a SublimeText widget ;)\n- [Thom1729](https://github.com/Thom1729) View.scope_selector algorithm author, he was able to understand Sublime's original behaviour, original issue born [here](https://github.com/SublimeTextIssues/Core/issues/2152)\n\n\n",
