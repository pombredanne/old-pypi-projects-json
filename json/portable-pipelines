        "description": "# Portable Pipelines\n\n## Quickstart\n\nInstall through PIP ([project page](https://pypi.org/project/portable-pipelines/)):\n```\npip install portable-pipelines\n```\n\n## About\n\nThis project was produced as part of the Portable Pipelines Project in partnership with:\n- [Melbourne Bioinformatics (University of Melbourne) ](https://www.melbournebioinformatics.org.au/)\n- [Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre](https://www.petermac.org/)\n- [Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research (WEHI) ](https://www.wehi.edu.au/)\n\n## Usage\n\nYou must import `Pipeline` into your project, that is:\n```python\nimport Pipeline as p\n``` \n\n### Included definitions\n\nSome unix tools have been wrapped and included as part of the pip module. They are located at `Pipeline.unix.tools/`.\nThe examples will use the included unix tools, with more information about bioinformatics tools down below. \nSee the section about contributions if you find an error in the tool definitions.\n\n### Creating workflows\n\nA Workflow consists of inputs, outputs and steps (which each have their own tool).\nYou can connect these components together with edges. Let's look the simple untar workflow.\n\n```python\nimport Pipeline as p\nfrom Pipeline.unix.tools.echo import Echo \n\nw = p.Workflow(\"workflow_identifier\")\n\ninp = p.Input(\"input_identifier\", p.String())\nstep = p.Step(\"step_identifier\", Echo())\noutp = p.Output(\"output_identifier\")\n\nw.add_pipe(inp, step, outp)\n\n# Will print the CWL, input file and relevant tools to the console\nw.dump_cwl(to_disk=False)\n```\n\n\n## Bioinformatics tools and data types\n\n_Coming soon_\n\nA repository of bioinformatic tools will be build to use within this pipeline. \nThe git submodule is embedded here for reference, but can also be found here: [here](https://github.com/PMCC-BioinformaticsCore/pipelines-bioinformatics).\n\n### Intended usage\n\n```\npip install portable-pipeline-bioinformatics\n```\n\n\n## Contributions\n\nContributions are the bread and butter of open source, and we welcome contributions. \nAll sections of this module are written in Python, however a fair understanding of Workflows, CWL or WDL \nmight be required to make changes.\n\nIf you find an issue with Pipeline related functionality, please report it through the \n[Github issues page](https://github.com/PMCC-BioinformaticsCore/pipelines/issues).\n\nIf you find an issue with the tool definitions, please see the relevant issue page:\n- [Pipeline-bioinformatics](https://github.com/PMCC-BioinformaticsCore/pipelines-bioinformatics/issues)\n\n\n### Releasing Portable Pipelines\n\nCurrently the release process is manual. The intent is to run this project through a continuous integration \nsystem for automatic releases on passing commits to master.\n\nTo release, increment the version in `setup.py`, run the following command to generate the release binary\n```\npython setup.py bdist_wheel\n```\n\nTo complete the upload, you will need to install `twine` and have your Pip settings configured:\n\n```\npython -m twine upload dist/portable_pipelines-$VERSION-py3-none-any.whl\n``` \n\nAnd that's it!\n\n\n",
