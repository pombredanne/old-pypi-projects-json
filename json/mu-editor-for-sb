Having said that, Mu is for anyone who wants to use\na simple \"no frills\" editor.\n\nMu is a modal editor with modes for Adafruit's CircuitPython, the micro:bit's\nversion of MicroPython, PyGame Zero and standard Python 3 (including a\ngraphical debugger). Some of the modes make available a REPL (either\nrunning on the connected CircuitPython or MicroPython device or as a Jupyter\nbased iPython session in Python3 mode).\n\nMu is written in Python and works on Windows, macOS, Linux and Raspberry Pi. The\nproject's public facing website is\n`https://codewith.mu/ <https://codewith.mu/>`_. We celebrate the work done by\nusers of mu at `https://madewith.mu/ <https://madewith.mu/>`_.\n\nWe have `extensive developer documentation <https://mu.readthedocs.io/>`_\nincluding a guide for\n`setting up a development environment <https://mu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html>`_, \n`contributor guidelines <https://mu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html>`_ and\n`some suggested first steps <https://mu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/first-steps.html>`_.\n\nWe want our community to be a friendly place. Therefore, we expect contributors\nand collaborators to follow our\n`Code of Conduct <https://mu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_of_conduct.html>`_.\n\n\nRelease History\n---------------\n\n1.1.0-alpha.1\n=============\n\nThe first alpha release of 1.1. This version may contain bugs and is unfinished\n(more new features will be added in later alpha releases or, depending on\nfeedback, we may change the behaviour of existing features). Please provide bug\nreports or feedback via: https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/issues/new\n\n* **NEW FEATURE** Installation of third party packages from PyPI. Click on the\n  cog icon to open the admin dialog and select the \"Third Party Packages\" tab.\n* **NEW FEATURE** Code tidy via the wonderful code formatter\n  `Black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_. Click the new \"Tidy\"\n  button to reformat and tidy your code so it looks more readable. If your code\n  has errors, these will be pointed out. Many thanks to Black's creator and\n  maintainer, \u0141ukasz Langa, for this contribution.\n* **NEW FEATURE** A new ESP8266 / ESP32 mode for working with these WiFi\n  enabled cheap IoT boards. Many thanks to Martin Dybdal for driving this\n  work forward and doing the heavy lifting. Thanks also to Murilo Polese for\n  testing and very constructive input in the review stage of this feature.\n* **OS CHANGE** Due to Qt's and Travis's lack of support, Mu will only run on\n  Mac OS 10.12 and above.\n* Ensure line-number margin is not too sensitive to inaccurate clicking from\n  young coders trying to position the cursor at the beginning of the line.\n  Thanks to Tiago Montes for this enhancement.\n* Fix some typos in the French translation. Thank you to GitHub user\n  @camillem.\n* Fix a bug relating to Adafruit boards when a file on a board which is then\n  unplugged is saved, Mu used to crash. Thanks to Melissa LeBlanc-Williams for\n  the report of this problem.\n* Fix problem with a missing newline at the end of a file. Thanks to Melissa\n  LeBlanc-Williams for the eagle-eyes and fix.\n* Fix for PYTHONPATH related problems on Windows (the current directory is now\n  on the path when a script is run). Thanks to Tim Golden for this fix.\n* Update to locale detection (use Qt's QLocale class). Thanks to Tiago Montes\n  for making this happen.\n* Fix bug relating to match selection of non-ASCII characters. Thank you to\n  Tiago Montes for this work.\n* Fixed various encoding related issues on OSX.\n* Various minor / trivial bug fixes and tidy ups.\n\n1.0.2\n=====\n\nAnother bugfix and translation release.

Thanks to Tim Golden and Tim\n  McCurrach for helping to test the fix.\n* Added Argon, Boron and Xenon boards to Adafruit mode since they're also\n  supported by Adafruit's CircuitPython.\n* The directory used to start a load/save dialog is either what the user last\n  selected, the current directory of the current file or the mode's working\n  directory (in order of precedence). This is reset when the mode is changed.\n* Various minor typo and bug fixes.\n\n1.0.1\n=====\n\nThis is a bugfix and new translation release. No new features were added.
