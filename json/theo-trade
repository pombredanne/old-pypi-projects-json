        "description": "# theo-trade\n\nIt is the API what makes using trade related API easy.\n\nKiwoom is the API to control Kiwoom open API.  \nKiwoom provides various interfaces, but the interfaces are not matched with others.  \nThis module wants to support same interfaces for trade API.\n\nI am likely waiting a any kind of contribution.\n\n\n# Theo series\n\nFramework : pip install theo-framework, https://github.com/TheodoreWon/python-theo-framework  \nDatabase : pip install theo-database, https://github.com/TheodoreWon/python-theo-database  \nMessage : pip install theo-message, https://github.com/TheodoreWon/python-theo-message  \nTrade : pip install theo-trade, https://github.com/TheodoreWon/python-theo-trade\n\n\n# How to use\n\nInstall the framework  \n> pip install theo-trade\n\nPrint docstrings  \n> from theo.trade import Kiwoom, KiwoomCtrl  \n> print(Kiwoom.&#95;&#95;doc&#95;&#95;)  \n> print(KiwoomCtrl.&#95;&#95;doc&#95;&#95;)  \n\n\n# How to setup the Kiwoom\n\nStep 1. Download  \n> Open the website, Kiwoom  \n> Find and click the 'Open API' from bottom of the page  \n> Select 'Kiwoom Open API+ Module Donwload'  \n> At the page, we can get the API document, development guide, KOA Studio  \n>> The Open API Installer is downloaded and stored at 'theo/ref/trade/OpenAPISetup.exe'  \n\nStep 2. Registration  \n> At the 'Open API' page, select 'Register simulated stock investment' and register to use the Open API without a real account.  \n> If connection with a real account is needed, registration is possible from 'Register/Cancel service' tab.  \n\nStep 3. Install  \n> Execute the installer what is downloaded  \n\n\n# Authors\n\nTheodore Won - Owner of this project\n\n\n# License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details\n\n\n# Versioning\n\nBasically, this project follows the 'Semantic Versioning'. (https://semver.org/)  \nBut, to notify new feature, I added several simple rules at the Semantic Versioning.  \nI would like to call 'Theo Versioning'.\n\n- Version format is MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH  \n- MAJOR version is increased when API is changed or when new feature is provided.  \n  - New feature does not affect a interface.  \n  - But, to notify new feature, New feature makes MAJOR version up.  \n  - Before official version release (1.0.0), MAJOR is kept 0 and MINOR version is used.  \n- MINOR version is up when the API is added. (New functionality)  \n- PATCH version is lifted when bug is fixed, test code is uploaded, comment or document or log is updated.  \n\n\n",
