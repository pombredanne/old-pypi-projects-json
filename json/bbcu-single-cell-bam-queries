        "description": "**Edit a file, create a new file, and clone from Bitbucket in under 2 minutes**\n\nWhen you're done, you can delete the content in this README and update the file with details for others getting started with your repository.\n\n*We recommend that you open this README in another tab as you perform the tasks below. You can [watch our video](https://youtu.be/0ocf7u76WSo) for a full demo of all the steps in this tutorial. Open the video in a new tab to avoid leaving Bitbucket.*\n\n---\n\n## Edit a file\n\nYou\u2019ll start by editing this README file to learn how to edit a file in Bitbucket.\n\n1. Click **Source** on the left side.\n2. Click the README.md link from the list of files.\n3. Click the **Edit** button.\n4. Delete the following text: *Delete this line to make a change to the README from Bitbucket.*\n5. After making your change, click **Commit** and then **Commit** again in the dialog. The commit page will open and you\u2019ll see the change you just made.\n6. Go back to the **Source** page.\n\n---\n\n## Create a file\n\nNext, you\u2019ll add a new file to this repository.\n\n1. Click the **New file** button at the top of the **Source** page.\n2. Give the file a filename of **contributors.txt**.\n3. Enter your name in the empty file space.\n4. Click **Commit** and then **Commit** again in the dialog.\n5. Go back to the **Source** page.\n\nBefore you move on, go ahead and explore the repository. You've already seen the **Source** page, but check out the **Commits**, **Branches**, and **Settings** pages.\n\n---\n\n## Clone a repository\n\nUse these steps to clone from SourceTree, our client for using the repository command-line free. Cloning allows you to work on your files locally. If you don't yet have SourceTree, [download and install first](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). If you prefer to clone from the command line, see [Clone a repository](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/4whODQ).\n\n1. You\u2019ll see the clone button under the **Source** heading. Click that button.\n2. Now click **Check out in SourceTree**. You may need to create a SourceTree account or log in.\n3. When you see the **Clone New** dialog in SourceTree, update the destination path and name if you\u2019d like to and then click **Clone**.\n4. Open the directory you just created to see your repository\u2019s files.\n\nNow that you're more familiar with your Bitbucket repository, go ahead and add a new file locally. You can [push your change back to Bitbucket with SourceTree](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/iqyBMg), or you can [add, commit,](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8QhODQ) and [push from the command line](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/NQ0zDQ).",
