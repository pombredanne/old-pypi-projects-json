        "description": "Purpose\n-------\n\nAn easy-to-use method of replacing makefiles.  This is primarily intended for use in compiling C and C++ programs without having to use makefiles, but it could probably be abused in some other way as well.  In addition to aiding in the building of a file, `makery` also provides an explicit mechanism for time-stamped build logging.\n\n.. image:: examples/images/screenshot-gcc-build.png\n\nImplementation\n--------------\n\nProjects\n========\n\nMakery utilizes the concept of a 'project' which mates the source files, executables, and options into a single human-readable and human-editable file.  This file is formatted in `json` and will usually be found in the directory that is common to all of a project's files.\n\nEach project describes a unique build of a particular configuration.  In some spaces, the concept of 'debug' and 'release' builds are common.  In makery, a 'debug' and 'release' project file will simply have a `debug.json` and `release.json` file associated with it.\n\nWorkflow\n========\n\nGenerally, a project is created using the integrated GUI.  The GUI can be used exclusively for interaction with `makery` on a single system, but command-line equivalents exist for more automated build environments.  The rough initial order is defined below.\n\n - project creation\n   - define source/include/linker files\n   - define tool suites\n   - define options\n - build\n   - compile\n   - link\n - execute\n   - run the program\n\nBuilding\n========\n\nOnce all source files, tools, and options have been specified, one may build a project using the GUI or command-line tools.\n\nDebugging\n========\n\nDebugging is supported using the `gdbgui` package.  Debugging is NOT currently supported for embedded platforms using openOCD, but that is a goal of this project.\n\nRunning\n=======\n\nIf the output is an executable, then the program may also be executed using the GUI.  The output will be shown in the console and logged.\n\nUse\n---\n\nInitial Project\n===============\n\nFrom the command-line, it is possible to simply run `makery`:\n\n    $> makery\n\nWhen run without options, the makery GUI is instantiated which is intended to be a hub for project creation and may be used for compiling, linking, and running a project as well.\n\nAdditional Options\n==================\n\nWhen working from a defined project file, it is easy to execute any GUI functionality from the command line.  Executing `makery --help` reveals the basic menu:\n\n    Options:\n      --version           Show the version and exit.\n      -p, --project TEXT  path to the project file(mandatory for most command-line\n                          applications)\n      -c, --clean         clean the build directory for the project\n      -b, --build         build the project into an executable\n      --help              Show this message and exit.\n\nNote that executing makery without a project will result in opening a GUI which is intended to ease project creation.\n\nReleases\n========\n\nReleases will be provided in the form of executables for all major versions that should be able to run on most platforms, courtesy of `pyinstaller`.\n\n\n",
