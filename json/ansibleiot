        "description": "# ansible-iot\nAn MQTT agent for managing execution of Ansible Playbooks on IoT devices.\n\nAnsible IoT makes it possible to manage execution of Ansible Playbooks on\nLinux-based IoT devices that have [Ansible](github.com/ansible/ansible) or\n[Ansible Engine](ansible.com/ansible-engine) installed. It is possible to\nexecute Playbooks that are pre-installed or to publish Ansible\nPlaybooks via MQTT. When executing a Playbook all task data will\nbe published to an MQTT topic for consumption by other clients.\n\nThis project tries to stay as close as possible to the [AWX](github.com/ansible/awx) project\nin how it handles execution of Playbooks on isolated instances.\n\nThis project assumes that Ansible or Ansible Engine as well as Ansible\nPlaybooks are a part of device updates. It is only trying to solve the\nspecific problem of allows for remote command execution and configuration\nmanagement of IoT devices.\n\n### Notes:\nAWX code for running a Playbook on an isolated instance:\nhttps://github.com/ansible/awx/blob/bfea00f6dc6af0fb01057ce38e9d0337e6c589aa/awx/main/expect/run.py\n\nAWX code for interacting with the `run.py` tool:\nhttps://github.com/ansible/awx/blob/bfea00f6dc6af0fb01057ce38e9d0337e6c589aa/awx/main/expect/isolated_manager.py#L454\n\nPlaybook used by AWX that ships over necessary files to execute:\nhttps://github.com/ansible/awx/blob/bfea00f6dc6af0fb01057ce38e9d0337e6c589aa/awx/playbooks/run_isolated.yml\n\nPlaybook used by AWX to periodically check status and get results of Playbook run:\nhttps://github.com/ansible/awx/blob/bfea00f6dc6af0fb01057ce38e9d0337e6c589aa/awx/playbooks/check_isolated.yml\n\n`run.py` tool receives path to directory containing playbooks, inventory, etc as a variable.\n",
