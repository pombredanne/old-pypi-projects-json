        "description": "# Birdsong - A Python interface to the Canary API\n_Make talking to Canary easy_\n\n[Canary](https://canarylabs.com/en/products/historian) is a historian from [Canary Labs](https://github.com/CanaryLabs), and `birdsong` is a library for interfacing with it via Python.\n\nBirdsong will take care of the details of dealing with REST calls, tokens, continuations, and other powerful low level features to let you focus on making Canary sing.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n - [Installation](#installation)\n - [Quickstart](#quickstart)\n - [Usage](#usage)\n   - [Helper structures](#helper-structures)\n   - [Sending data to Canary: `CanarySender`](#sending-data-to-canary-canarysender)\n     - [Create new file: `createNewFile`](#create-new-file-createnewfile)\n     - [Create rollover file: `fileRollover`](#create-rollover-file-filerollover)\n     - [Store data: `storeData`](#store-data-storedata)\n   - [Viewing data in Canary: `CanaryView`](#viewing-data-in-canary-canaryview)\n     - [Exploring Canary: `browseNodes`](#exploring-canary-browsenodes)\n     - [Exploring tags: `browseTags`](#exploring-tags-browsetags)\n     - [Get node status: `browseStatus`](#get-node-status-browsestatus)\n     - [Option values: translate quality values: `getQualities`](#option-values-translate-quality-values-getqualities)\n     - [Option values: get aggregate values: `getAggregates`](#option-values-get-aggregate-values-getaggregates)\n     - [Get tag data: `getTagData`](#get-tag-data-gettagdata)\n     - [Get tag properties: `getTagProperties`](#get-tag-properties-gettagproperties)\n     - [Get *live* tag data: `getLiveData`](#get-live-tag-data-getlivedata)\n - [Advanced usage](#advanced-usage)\n - [Contributing](#contributing)\n - [License](#license)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Pip\n\nYou can use the packages on the PyPI via pip:\n```bash\npython -m pip install birdsong --upgrade\n```\n\n### Manual installation\nCopy the contents of the Canary folder into your `site-packages` folder in your Python `libs` folder.\nDepending on your environment, use the Git branch appropriate. \n\n\n### Ignition\n\n\nChoose the branch for the version of Ignition in use first. From there you may either:\n\nA) Copy the `/birdsong` directory from this repo into directly into Ignition's `./user-lib/pylib/site-packages/` directory.\nOn Windows systems this will likely be `C:\\Program Files\\Inductive Automation\\Ignition\\user-lib\\pylib\\site-packages`\n\nB) Copy the contents of the all-in-one python file into the project library in the Ignition Designer.\nThat file will be named something like `birdsong.ignition_8.py`.\n\nOnce copied, the install can be tested with the `./test/playground_test.py` file in that branch. \n(Change the import path if Birdsong was places somewhere other than `site-packages` or in `Project Library/birdsong`)\n\n## Quickstart\n\n```python\n# get started so quick we don't even have time for text outside a code block\nfrom birdsong import CanarySender, CanaryView, Tvq\n\nviewName = 'CS-Surface61'\ndatasetName = 'Testing2'\ntagPath = datasetName + '.Quick Data!!!'\nwith CanarySender(autoCreateDatasets=True) as sender:\n    sender.storeData({tagPath: [Tvq('2019-10-20 12:34Z', -666), Tvq('2019-10-20 15:20Z', 999)]})\n\n    with CanaryView() as view:\n        print(next(view.getTagData(viewName + '.' + tagPath)))\n```\n> ``` \n> {'timestamp': u'2019-10-20T15:20:00.0000000-07:00', 'value': 999}\n> ```\n\nIn this we:\n- Imported the Canary interfaces and a convenient helper\n- Connected to the localhost Canary Sender service on the default anonymous port\n- Stored two datapoints in the `Quick Data!` tag in the `Testing2` dataset (whether or not `Testing` already existed - it does _now_)\n- Connected to the localhost Canary View service on the default anonymous port\n- Got data from the `CS-Surface61` view (the name my computer gave my historian)...\n- ... and immediately consumed the first entry returned via Python's `next` keyword...\n- ... and printed it to the console (which the `Tvq` class autoformatted to look like a dictionary)\n- And after the `with` statements, Python exited the connections (first `view` then `sender`), revoking tokens as needed to free them up for others to use.\n\n> Inside baseball note: if the `view` was initialized outside the sender service's context (the `with` statement), the value returned would have been `None`, since we didn't tell the sender service to set `autoWriteNoData=False`. Thus, once the `with` ends the sender would have automatically marked an end to the data transmission session via a `No Data` entry. Pass in the flag to suppress that, if desired.\n\n## Important security notice: `noVerifySSL=False` by default\n\nBecause many Canary instances are on intranets and may or may not have certificates that are easily validated by a trusted central authority, SSL validation is *OFF by default*.\n\nYou may keep warnings on if you set `birdsong.rest.VALIDATE_SSL_CERTS = True` before initializing a connection to Canary. You may also manually turn on cert validation by passing in `verifySSL=True` to `CanaryView` and `CanarySender` on initialization.\n\n## Usage\n\nBy default, the connections will attach to `localhost` over an anonymous connection. If you're testing `birdsong` on the same machine as a Canary instance, it'll try to connect to that first.\n\nTokens will be aquired as needed. That means until a call is made that requires it, it won't request a user token. Further, it will keep trying to use the token until Canary throws an error on it; on token expiration, Canary will send an error and the interface class will automatically reaquire. You won't see the error other than a slight additional delay as the new token is reaquired.\n\nBoth `CanaryView` and `CanarySender` are designed to automatically clean themselves up when they go out of scope. For best practice, use it in a [context manager](https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/context_managers.html) Once instantiated, it will make the HTTP REST calls to Canary with the right user/session/livedata tokens. If they expire, it'll renew them on the next call.\n\n> For the purposes of the following examples, assume that Canary is running on `localhost`, and that machine is called `CS-Surface61`. Examples of how to log in will be sprinkled throughout as well. \n> Also assume that there is a dataset called `Testing` in which we'll be putting and pulling most of the data in the following examples.\n\nFor demo purposes, we'll assume that `Testing` is the dataset of choice, and our main view will be `CS-Surface61`:\n```python\nimport random, string\n\nhost     = 'localhost'\nmainView = 'CS-Surface61'\ndataset  = 'Testing'\n\ntagPaths = [\n     '.'.join([dataset, ''.join([random.choice(string.ascii_uppercase) for i in range(6)])])\n    for _ in range(3)\n]\nprint(tagPaths)\n```\n> ```\n> ['Testing.ADRLCO', 'Testing.XBCFZF', 'Testing.ITKORQ']\n> ```\n\nFor demo purposes, I'll be referencing these tags, unless stated otherwise.\n\n### Helper structures\n\nThree helper classes are provided: `Tvq`, `Property`, and `Annotation`. These are all based on a class that allow these to be created with a bit of flexibility. Importantly, these will ensure values are sent to Canary in the expected order while leaving optional values out.\n\n> Note: If Canary returns a date of `0001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000` this will be set on the `timestamp` fields as `None`. It's a value returned under some circumstances (like requesting data for a nonexistent tag in a valid dataset), but because it's not a valid time `birdsong` interprets this to make sure it can't be confused for a normal datetime object.\n\nTo generate an instance, pass in values either in order or by name:\n\n```python\n>>> tvq1 = Tvq('2019-10-01 03:00:00', 3) # quality is optional and assumed 192 GOOD\n>>> tvq2 = Tvq('2019-10-01 12:34:56', 999, 216)\n>>> tvq1\n{'timestamp': '2019-10-01 03:00:00', 'value': 3}\n>>> tvq2\n{'timestamp': '2019-10-01 12:34:56', 'quality': 216, 'value': 999}\n>>> tvq1.quality\nNone\n>>> tvq2.value\n999\n>>> tvq2.v\n999\n>>> tvq2['value']\n999\n>>> Tvq('0001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000-08:00',None)\n{'timestamp': None, 'value': None}\n```\n\nThe values for these are:\n\n| Helper Class | Attributes |\n| ---- | ---- |\n| Tvq | `timestamp`, `value`, `quality`* |\n| Property | `name`, `timestamp`, `value`, `quality` * |\n| Annotation | `user`, `timestamp`, `value`, `createdAt`* |\n> `*` are optional\n\nNote that these will attempt to convert the timestamp to an [Arrow](https://arrow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) datetime object. It's just like a normal `datetime` object, but a bit smarter and easier to manipulate. Combined with [ciso8601](https://github.com/closeio/ciso8601), this can quickly convert the timestamps to a highly flexible object.\n\nEach class has a settter like `Tvq.setTimeFormat('...')` that can be called in case something perverse like a _non_-ISO8601 date is parsed. Note that a timezone should be set. Canary returns results in a timezone sensitive way - *be _ever_ wary of naked timestamps, especially when searching, filtering, and storing data!*\n\nAlso note that once instantiated these are _immutible_. These are meant to be treated as read-only since no mechanism to feed directly back on the process is available.\n\n### Sending data to Canary: `CanarySender`\n\nThe `CanarySender` class works just like how views are worked with. \n\n#### Create new file: `createNewFile`\n\nUse this to create a new file that's not linked to the previous. Provide it with the dataset that gets a new file and the timestamp to apply to the file.\n\n```python\nwith CanarySender() as send:\n    send.createNewFile('Testing', '2019-10-01 00:00')\n```\n\n#### Create rollover file: `fileRollover`\n\nCreate a new file rolling over from the previous.\n\n```python\nwith CanarySender() as send:\n    send.fileRollover('Testing', '2019-10-01 00:00')\n```\n\n#### Store data: `storeData`\n\nThe `storeData` method logs both tvq values (time, value, quality) as well as properties and annotations. If there is any question about the tuples that should be sent to Canary, use the helper structs - these will be expanded correctly when sent.\n\nAll inputs are dictionaries where the keys are Canary tag paths and the values are lists of entries.\n\nStoring data is as easy as making a dictionary of tags and a list of their TVQ entries.\n\n```python\ntvqDict = {\n    tagPaths[1]: [\n        ('2019-10-01 01:11:11', 1.11),\n        ('2019-10-01 02:22:22', 2.22, 192),\n        Tvq('2019-10-01 03:33:33', 3.33),\n        Tvq('2019-10-01 04:44:44', 4.44, 192),\n    ],\n    tagPaths[2]: [\n        ('2019-10-01 01:00:00', 1),\n        ('2019-10-01 02:00:00', 2, 192),\n        Tvq('2019-10-01 03:00:00', 3),\n        Tvq('2019-10-01 04:00:00', 4, 192),\n    ]\n}\n\nwith CanarySender() as send:\n    send.storeData(tvqDict)\n```\n\nStore properties like so:\n```python\nwith CanarySender() as send:\n    send.storeData(properties={\n        tagPaths[0]: [['Some Property', '10/01/2019 12:00', 'A property value']]\n    })\n```\n> See the `getTagProperties` example for getting this back from the system.\n\nAnd annotations likewise:\n\n```python\nwith CanarySender() as send:\n    send.storeData(annotations={\n        tagPaths[0]: [['SHODAN', '11/7/2019 19:11', 'Passcode 711 missing']]\n    })\n```\n\n\n### Viewing data in Canary: `CanaryView`\n\nViews are how we look into the data Canary holds. The interface `birdsong` provides is the `CanaryView` class. \n\nPass in the following keywords to \n\n\n#### Exploring Canary: `browseNodes`\n\nIf my main Canary instance is on my computer (named `CS-Surface61`), then `browseNodes` will list the  \n```python\nfrom birdsong import CanaryView\n\nwith CanaryView() as view:\n\tfor node in view.browseNodes():\n\t\tprint(node)\n```\n> ```\n> Test Model\n> CS-Surface61\n> ```\n\nLikewise, we can drill in to get the datasets under a view:\n```python\nwith CanaryView() as view:\n\tfor node in view.browseNodes('CS-Surface61'):\n\t\tprint(node)\n```\n> ```\n> Testing\n> {Diagnostics}\n> ```\n\n#### Exploring tags: `browseTags`\n\nA tag listing can be retrieved by calling `browseTags`. The `path` argument is the root node to search under, while `search` will narrow the results down to values matching the tag (much as the search works in Axiom). Set `deep` to `True` to recursively search a node.\n\n```python\nwith CanaryView() as view:\n    for tagPath in view.browseTags(path='CS-Surface61.Testing'):\n        print tagPath\n```\n> ```\n> CS-Surface61.Testing.ADRLCO\n> CS-Surface61.Testing.ITKORQ\n> CS-Surface61.Testing.XBCFZF\n> ```\n> \n\nMy computer happens to have another testing dataset, which shows up in the following:\n```python\nwith CanaryView() as view:\n    for tagPath in view.browseTags(path='CS-Surface61', search='Testing', deep=True):\n        print tagPath\n```\n> ```\n> CS-Surface61.Testing.BKYTXS\n> CS-Surface61.Testing.FEZWZR\n> CS-Surface61.Testing.OCEGGC\n> CS-Surface61.Testing.QIFAFZ\n> CS-Surface61.Testing.RWNNHP\n> CS-Surface61.Testing.Some.Tag.Path.CV\n> CS-Surface61.Testing2.Quick Data!!!!\n> ```\n\n\n#### Get node status: `browseStatus`\n\nTo find out if a node has been updated, directly query it and check if the sequence number is different:\n```python\n>>> print(CanaryView().browseStatus('CS-Surface61'))\n```\nor muliple views at once:\n```python\nwith CanaryView() as view:\n    for viewName,sequence in view.browseStatus(['CS-Surface61','Test Model']):\n        print('%s  -  %s' % (viewName, sequence))\n```\n> ```\n> 637078138670000000  -  CS-Surface61\n> 637075536560000000  -  Test Model\n> ```\n\n\n#### Option values: translate quality values: `getQualities`\n\nUnless a returned value is `192` (`Good`), data is returned with a quality value. This is a value as enumerated by the OPC communication standard. Not everyone has all the values memorized, though, so you can look them up with this function.\n\n```python\nwith CanaryView(host='localhost') as view:\n    print view.getQualities('90')\n```\n> ```\n> {u'90': u'Uncertain-Sub Normal-Limit High'}\n> ```\n\nOr you can ask for more than one at a time (say from retrieved data)\n\n```python\nsomeDataQualities = [value.quality for value in someData if value.quality]\n\nwith CanaryView() as view:\n    print view.getQualities(someDataQualities)\n```\n> ```\n> {u'9': u'Bad-Not Connected-Limit Low', u'90': u'Uncertain-Sub Normal-Limit High', u'210': u'Good-Limit High'}\n> ```\n\n#### Option values: get aggregate values: `getAggregates`\n\nWhen getting data for a tag, you can set `aggregateName` to one of the values given by this dictionary.\n\n```python\nwith CanaryView() as view:\n    print(sorted(view.getAggregates().keys()))\n```\n>```\n> [u'Average', u'Count', u'Delta', u'DeltaBounds', u'DurationBad', u'DurationGood', u'DurationInStateNonZero', u'DurationInStateZero', u'End', u'EndBound', u'Instant', u'Interpolative', u'Maximum', u'Maximum2', u'MaximumActualTime', u'MaximumActualTime2', u'Minimum', u'Minimum2', u'MinimumActualTime', u'MinimumActualTime2', u'NumberOfTransitions', u'PercentBad', u'PercentGood', u'Range', u'Range2', u'StandardDeviationPopulation', u'StandardDeviationSample', u'Start', u'StartBound', u'TimeAverage', u'TimeAverage2', u'Total', u'Total2', u'TotalPer24Hours', u'TotalPerHour', u'TotalPerMinute', u'VariancePopulation', u'VarianceSample', u'WorstQuality', u'WorstQuality2']\n> ```\n\n#### Get tag data: `getTagData`\n\nTo get the most recent value for a tag, simply call `getTagData` with that tag's path:\n\n```python\n# Get the default value (most recent - may well be the No Data value)\nwith CanaryView() as view:\n\tfor value in view.getTagData('CS-Surface61.Testing.ADRLCO'):\n\t\tprint(value)\t\t\n```\n> ```\n> {'timestamp': u'2019-10-01T04:56:12.0000001-07:00', 'value': None}\n> ```\n\n> Note: as we log data to Canary and close our sessions, Canary will assume the data stream has come to an end and bracket it with `No Data`, which will show as a `None` in our results here.\n\nTo get the values for a tag between two time spans, simply pass in the constraints as arguments:\n\n```python\n# Get all values between dates\ntagPath = mainView + '.' + dataset + '.' + 'ADRLCO'\n\nwith CanaryView() as view:\n    for value in view.getTagData(tagPath, \n                                 startTime='2019-10-01T00:00:00-0700',\n                                 endTime='2019-10-01T03:00-0700'):\n        print(value)\n```\n> ```\n> {'timestamp': u'2019-10-01T01:23:45.0000000-07:00', 'value': 1.23}\n> {'timestamp': u'2019-10-01T02:34:56.0000000-07:00', 'value': 2.34}\n> ```\n\nAny of the constraints outlined in your Canary View's `/help` endpoint will work.\n\nGetting data for more than one tag simply means passing in a list of tags.\n```python\ntagList = [mainView + '.' + tagPath for tagPath in tagPaths[1:3]]\n\n# Get the default value (most recent - will be the No Data value)\nwith CanaryView() as view:\n    for tagPath, values in view.getTagData(tagList):\n        print(tagPath)\n        for value in values:\n            print('\\t%r' % value)\n```\n> ```\n> CS-Surface61.Testing.XBCFZF\n> \t{'timestamp': u'2019-10-01T04:44:44.0000001-07:00', 'value': None}\n> CS-Surface61.Testing.ITKORQ\n> \t{'timestamp': u'2019-10-01T04:00:00.0000001-07:00', 'value': None}\n> ```\n\nPay special attention that the results match the input: if a tag path is given by itself, you'll get back an iterable of values. If a list of tags are given, you'll get back an iterable back of the tag paths and their values. (These will be in the same order given.) \n\nIf a start and end time is given it will look like this:\n```python\n# Get the values for each tag between given dates\nwith CanaryView() as view:\n    for tagPath, values in view.getTagData(tagList, \n                                           start='2019-10-01T00:00:00-0700',\n                                           end='2019-10-01T03:00-0700'):\n        print(tagPath)\n        for value in values:\n            print('\\t%r' % value)\n```\n> ```\n> CS-Surface61.Testing.XBCFZF\n> \t{'timestamp': u'2019-10-01T01:11:11.0000000-07:00', 'value': 1.11}\n> \t{'timestamp': u'2019-10-01T02:22:22.0000000-07:00', 'value': 2.22}\n> CS-Surface61.Testing.ITKORQ\n> \t{'timestamp': u'2019-10-01T01:00:00.0000000-07:00', 'value': 1}\n> \t{'timestamp': u'2019-10-01T02:00:00.0000000-07:00', 'value': 2}\n> ```\n\nNote that `start` and `end` were used here. For convenience these are automatically translated to the naming convention Canary expects. (I caught myself writing the wrong suffix too much...)\n\n```python\nwith CanaryView() as view:\n    tagProps = view.getTagProperties('CS-Surface61.' + tagPaths[0])\n    print(tagProps)\n```\n> ```\n> {u'Some Property': u'A property value'}\n> ```\n> Note that this result comes from the later `storeData` routine.\n\nPassing in a list results in a generator:\n\n```\ntagList = ['CS-Surface61.' + tagPath for tagPath in tagPaths[:2]]\nwith CanaryView() as view:\n    for tagPath, propDict in view.getTagProperties(tagList):\n        print('%s - %r' % (tagPath, propDict))\n```\n> ```\n> CS-Surface61.Testing.QIFAFZ - {u'Some Property': u'A property value'}\n> CS-Surface61.Testing.OCEGGC - {}\n> ```\n\n\n#### Get tag properties: `getTagProperties`\n\nTag properties can be queried by the `getTagProperties` function. This will return the most recent value set for each property for a tag.\n\nLike the other `get` iterator methods, this will likewise return a dict object or a generator when a list of tag paths is provided.\n\n\n#### Get *live* tag data: `getLiveData`\n\nCanary provides a special API call for getting the most recent data _since the last time you asked_ in the `getLiveData` method. Birdsong will manage the token needed to take advantage of this.\n\nThe easiest way to use it is like the regular tag data method:\n```python\ntagPath = '.'.join([mainView, dataset, tagPaths[0]])\n\nwith CanaryView() as view:\n    for value in view.getLiveData(tagPath):\n\t\tprint(value)\n```\n> ```\n> {'timestamp': u'2019-10-27T16:03:10.4280000-07:00', 'value': 0}\n> ```\n\nThis tag happens to have another thread pumping data in via `CanarySender().storeData()`, so if we connect and check periodically we'll see additional updates as they come in:\n```python\nstepTime = 3\n\nwith CanaryView() as view:\n    for step in range( (testDuration//stepTime) + 2):\n        print('Update %d' % step)\n\n        for value in view.getLiveData(tagPath):\n            print(value)\n\n        sleep(stepTime)\n```\n> ```\n> Update 0\n> {'timestamp': u'2019-10-27T16:03:12.4490000-07:00', 'value': 100}\n> Update 1\n> {'timestamp': u'2019-10-27T16:03:14.4590000-07:00', 'value': 200}\n> {'timestamp': u'2019-10-27T16:03:16.4690000-07:00', 'value': 300}\n> Update 2\n> {'timestamp': u'2019-10-27T16:03:18.4740000-07:00', 'value': 400}\n> Update 3\n> {'timestamp': u'2019-10-27T16:03:18.4740001-07:00', 'value': None}\n> ```\n\nLikewise, multiple tags can also be checked. For this example, we'll only be updating tags that _aren't the first_. \n```python\n# Check all tags so that we can see the first _not_ get updated in later calls\n\nviewQualifiedTagPaths = [mainView + '.' + tagPath for tagPath in tagPaths]\nstepTime = 3\n\nwith CanaryView() as view:\n    for step in range( (testDuration//stepTime)+2):\n        print('Update %d' % step)\n\n        for tagPath,values in view.getLiveData(viewQualifiedTagPaths):\n            print('\\t%s' % tagPath)\n\n            for value in values:\n                print('\\t\\t%r' % value)\n        sleep(stepTime)\n```\n> ```\n> Update 0\n> \tCS-Surface61.Testing.ITKORQ\n> \t\t{'timestamp': u'2019-10-27T16:02:39.4040000-07:00', 'value': 1}\n> \tCS-Surface61.Testing.ADRLCO\n> \t\t{'timestamp': u'2019-10-27T16:00:52.1000001-07:00', 'value': None}\n> \tCS-Surface61.Testing.XBCFZF\n> \t\t{'timestamp': u'2019-10-27T16:02:39.4040000-07:00', 'value': 0}\n> Update 1\n> \tCS-Surface61.Testing.ITKORQ\n> \t\t{'timestamp': u'2019-10-27T16:02:41.4190000-07:00', 'value': 101}\n> \tCS-Surface61.Testing.XBCFZF\n> \t\t{'timestamp': u'2019-10-27T16:02:41.4190000-07:00', 'value': 100}\n> Update 2\n> \tCS-Surface61.Testing.ITKORQ\n> \t\t{'timestamp': u'2019-10-27T16:02:43.4390000-07:00', 'value': 201}\n> \t\t{'timestamp': u'2019-10-27T16:02:45.4500000-07:00', 'value': 301}\n> \tCS-Surface61.Testing.XBCFZF\n> \t\t{'timestamp': u'2019-10-27T16:02:43.4390000-07:00', 'value': 200}\n> \t\t{'timestamp': u'2019-10-27T16:02:45.4500000-07:00', 'value': 300}\n> Update 3\n> \tCS-Surface61.Testing.ITKORQ\n> \t\t{'timestamp': u'2019-10-27T16:02:47.4560000-07:00', 'value': 401}\n> \tCS-Surface61.Testing.XBCFZF\n> \t\t{'timestamp': u'2019-10-27T16:02:47.4560000-07:00', 'value': 400}\n> ```\n\nNote that `CS-Surface61.Testing.ADRLCO` didn't show up past the first loop iteration. That's because the tag had no new data (and the `None` is the result of that - the other two's last update would have shown the same had it been let go one more iteration.)\n\n\n## Advanced usage\n\nGiven this is Python, we can do a number of handy things.\n\nFor example, we can predefine values for configurations and use `**kwarg` expansion to map the configuration dict values to the function.\n\n```python\n# Send a random number to a tag every 5 seconds forever\nfrom birdsong import CanarySender, Tvq, Annotation\nimport random\nimport arrow\n\nsenderConfig = {\n\t'username': 'AzureDiamond',\n\t'password': 'hunter2',\n\t'autoCreateDatasets': True,\n\t'autoWriteNoData': False\n}\n\ntagPath = 'CS-Surface61.Testing.Random Noise'\n\nwith CanarySender(**senderConfig) as send:\n\n\trightNow = arrow.utcnow().isoformat()\n\n\tupdateData = {\n\t\t'tvqs': {tagPath: (rightNow, random.random())},\n\t\t'annotations': {tagPath: (senderConfig['username'],rightNow,'Inserted Data')}\n\t}\n\n    send.storeData(**updateData)\n\n    sleep(5)\n```\n\n(Don't use annotations like this, though...)\n\nYou can also use the interfaces outside of a context manager. When the object goes out of scope it'll get the connection tokens cleaned up automatically. Note that this will _not_ guarantee cleanup in the event the program shuts down gracelessly (but it'll try, given the chance).\n\nFor example, you may want to initiate your live data connection, but not close it. Or you just don't want to indent everything. And, just to be sure, you can close the connection yourself using `__exit__`. Or to be brutal, go ahead and use the `del` command.\n\n```python\nfrom birdsong import CanaryView\nimport arrow\n\n# Create the object.\nview = CanaryView()\n\ntagSetOne = [\n\t'CS-Surface61.Testing.Test Tag 1', \n\t'CS-Surface61.Testing.Test Tag 2'\n]\n\ntagSetTwo = [\n\t'CS-Surface61.Testing.Some Other Tag'\n]\n\nloopCount = 0\nwhile True:\n    print('Update %d' % loopCount)\n\n    for tagPath,values in view.getLiveData(tagSetOne):\n        print('\\t%s' % tagPath)\n        for value in values:\n            print('\\t\\t%r' % value)\n\n    for tagPath,values in view.getLiveData(tagSetTwo):\n        print('\\t%s' % tagPath)\n        for value in values:\n            print('\\t\\t%r' % value)\n\n    sleep(stepTime)\n\n# Manually close out the connection\nview.__exit__()\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nFeel free to send suggestions and bug notices (especially if the API shifts/upgrades and is not caught quickly). Features requests are also welcome, though this is primarily meant to act as an interface wrapper library rather than an extension (though 'unpythonic' constructs will be considered bugs :)\n\n## License\n\n[Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n\n\n",
