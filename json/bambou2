It works on top of the `requests` library and provides an object oriented layer for manipulating ReST entities.\n\n`Bambou2` can not be used as is, and it's mainly used by the Nuage Networks' `vsdk` and `vspk`.\n\n\n# License\n\nCopyright (c) 2019, Nokia Inc.\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this\n  list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,\n  this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation\n  and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n* Neither the name of bambou2 nor the names of its\n  contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from\n  this software without specific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED.
