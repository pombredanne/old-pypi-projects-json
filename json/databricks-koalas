        "description": "[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/databricks/spark-pandas.svg?token=Rzzgd1itxsPZRuhKGnhD&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/databricks/spark-pandas)\n\n# Koalas: Pandas APIs on Apache Spark\n\nThis package augments PySpark's DataFrame API to \nmake it compliant (mostly) with the Pandas API.\n\nPandas is the de facto standard (single-node) dataframe implementation in Python, while\nApache Spark is the de facto standard for big data processing. This package helps you in two ways:\n - it allows you to keep a single codebase that works both with Pandas (tests, smaller datasets) and with Spark (distributed datasets)\n - it makes you immediately productive with Spark if you already know Pandas.\n\n\n## Dependencies\n\n - Spark 2.4. Some older versions of Spark may work too but they are not officially supported.\n - A recent version of Pandas. It is officially developed against 0.23+ but some other versions may work too.\n - Python 3.5+ if you want to use type hints in UDFs. Work is ongoing to also support Python 2.\n\n\n## How to install & use\n\nPending publication on the PyPI repository, a compiled package can be installed by using\nthis URL:\n\n```bash\npip install https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/databricks-tjhunter/koala/databricks_koala-0.0.5-py3-none-any.whl\n```\n\nAfter installing the package, you can import the package:\n\n```py\nimport databricks.koalas\n```\n\nThat's it. Now you have turned all the Spark Dataframes \nthat will be created from now on into API-compliant Pandas \ndataframes.\n\nExample:\n\n```py\nimport pandas as pd\npdf = pd.DataFrame({'x':range(3), 'y':['a','b','b'], 'z':['a','b','b']})\n\ndf = spark.from_pandas(pdf)\n\n# Rename the columns\ndf.columns = ['x', 'y', 'z1']\n\n# Do some operations in place:\ndf['x2'] = df.x * df.x\n```\n\n\n## License\n\nThe license of the Koalas project is Apache 2.0. See the `LICENSE` file for more details.\n\nSome files have been adapted from the Dask project, under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license\nand the Dask license. See the file `licenses/LICENSE-dask.txt` for more details.\n\n## What is available\n\nPandas has a very extensive API and currently Koalas only supports a subset of the Pandas API.\nThe authoritative status is this spreadsheet, available as a Google document:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GwBvGsqZAFFAD5PPc_lffDEXith353E1Y7UV6ZAAHWA/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Current status\n\nThis project is currently in beta and is rapidly evolving.\nYou should expect the following differences:\n\n - some functions may be missing (see the [What is available](#what-is-available) section)\n\n - some behaviour may be different, in particular in the treatment of nulls: Pandas uses\n   Not a Number (NaN) special constants to indicate missing values, while Spark has a\n   special flag on each value to indicate missing values. We would love to hear your use\n   case if you find differences.\n\n - because Spark is lazy in nature, some operations like creating new columns only get \n   performed when Spark needs to print or write the dataframe.\n\n\n\n## How to contribute\n\nAre you missing a function from Pandas? No problem! Most functions are very easy to add\nby simply wrapping the existing Pandas function.\n\n 1. Look at [the list of implemented functions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GwBvGsqZAFFAD5PPc_lffDEXith353E1Y7UV6ZAAHWA/edit?usp=sharing) to see if a pull request already exists\n\n 2. Wrap your function and submit it as a pull request\n\nIf the function already has the same name in Apache Spark and if the results differ, the \ngeneral policy is to follow the behaviour of Spark and to document the changes.\n\n\n",
