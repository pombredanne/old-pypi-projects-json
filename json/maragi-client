        "description": "# MARAGI Client\n\nMARAGI \n- Microservices \n- Architecture for \n- Robotics and \n- Artificial \n- General \n- Intelligence\n\nThis client can be used by any microservice to communicate with the core MARAGI service (SOC or Stream of Consciousness).\n\n# Usage\n\nThere are two basic functions when interacting with the SOC: \n\n- Adding messages\n- Fetching messages\n\nYou can use the client to perform either action. \n\n## Instantiate a client\n\nThe MARAGI client talks to the core MARAGI service, the Stream of Consciousness using REST API\n\n```python\nimport maragi_client\nclient = maragi_client.Client()\n# optional, specify port and ip\nclient = maragi_client.Client(ip='##', port='##')\n```\n\n## Add Message\n\nTo add a message you will need several pieces of information. See below example in code. Note: You don't need to add a timestamp to the message, as that is handled by the SOC service. \n\n```python\nmetadata = 'vision.optical.object_detection'\nlabel = '89.95%'\norigin = 'pedestrian_detector'\nmessage = 'pedestrians detected in upper left quadrant'\n\nclient.add_message(metadata, label, origin, message)\n```\n\n### Metadata\n\nThe metadata component of the payload is the *data about the data*. This information can be used by the system and other services to collect relevant information together. \nFor instance, a service may want to collect all visual messages, regardless of source. Metadata is used by MARAGI to organize streams of information in the SOC.\nMore examples of metadata:\n\n- `audio.speech_recognition`\n- `optical.face_detection`\n- `knowledge.encyclopedia.entry`\n- `action.speech.proposal`\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that the SOC contains a lot more than just sensory input. It also contains beliefs, knowledge, ideas, and actions. Think of it as a classification for the message. \n\n### Label\n\nThe label for the message is, in fact, another form of metadata. It is particular to the message, though. Labels do not always need to be used, but they can be very helpful. \nFor instance, a speech recognition service may include the identity of the speaker. In the previous example, the label includes the certainty of the detection. \n\n### Origin\n\nThe origin is simply the name of the service that created the message. This is useful for several purposes:\n\n- Human diagnostics and observation of the SOC\n- Metacognitive services, such as policing and injunctive services\n\n### Message\n\nThis is the core message that needs to be added to the SOC. Sensory input, thoughts, evaluations, ideas, actions, knowledge, memories, and plans are all examples of SOC messages.\n\n## Fetch Messages\n\nThe MARAGI SOC service provides a few endpoints for fast retrieval of messages. By and large, the responsibility is on the individual microservices to find what they need. \nThe SOC is meant to be fast and accessible. Filtration and sifting, therefore, is the responsibility of each microservice. \n\n```python\nmessages = client.fetch_message('search term')\nmessages = client.fetch_recent(60)\nmessages = client.fetch_range(50, 70)\nmessages = client.fetch_label('Dave')\nmessages = client.fetch_metadata('sensor')\nmessages = client.fetch_origin('bad_jokes')\n```\n\n# Installation\n\n```python\npip install maragi_client\n```\n\n",
