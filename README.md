# Old PyPI Projects JSON

In the process of identifying which removed projects are malicious, it's helpful to have
more training data.  This data comes from a long-running bandersnatch instance, and is
prettyprinted, but provides a historical view with last upload dates between
2017-09-15 and 2020-02-16.

The only modification I have made is canonicalizing the filenames (you can get back the
original name from the `.info.name` in the file).

This will eventually be merged with what's available in drd for a more complete view of
what was previously on pypi.

# license

Short answer: I chose CC0

Longer answer:

I am not a lawyer.  This metadata was originally provided to aid distribution, and
publicly available, but metadata isn't specifically called out as a use in the [pypi
ToU](https://pypi.org/policy/terms-of-use/).

I am happy to exclude individual projects if you object via github issue here.
